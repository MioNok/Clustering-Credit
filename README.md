# Kaggle datasets analysis

This repository contains some kaggle datasets I have analyzed using different data science methods and graphs.

Currently there are two different datasets analyzed _here:_

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Clustering Credit**: I analyze credit card data with different _clusters_.  

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**Telco Customer Churn**: I use _decision trees_ and _random forests_ to predict customer curn.
